# Contributing Guide

We are excited that you are interested in contributing to UI Toolkit. Before submitting your contribution though, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines.


Issue Guidelines
---

- Issues are exclusively for bug reports, feature requests and design-related topics. Other questions may be closed directly.

- Before submitting an issue, please check if similar problems have already been issued.

Pull Request Guidelines
---

- Fork this repository to your own account. Do not create branches here.

- Commit info should be formatted as `[Component Name]: Info about commit.` (e.g. `Button: Fix xxx bug`)

- Rebase before creating a PR to keep commit history clear.

- If your PR fixes a bug, please provide a description about the related bug.

- Merging a PR takes two maintainers: one approves the changes after reviewing, and then the other reviews and merges.
