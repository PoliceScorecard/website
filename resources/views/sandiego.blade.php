                    <strong>Police Scorecard</strong> evaluated the policing practices of San Diego Police Department (SDPD) and
                    San Diego Sheriff's Department (SDSD).

                <p>
                    Our results show both departments to be engaged in a pattern of discriminatory policing. <strong>Both
                    departments stopped black people at a rate more than 2x higher than white people and were more
                    likely to search, arrest, and use force against black people during a stop.</strong> Both
                    departments not only use force more often but also use more severe forms of force against black people
                    than other groups, even after controlling for arrest rates and alleged level of resistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also found evidence of <strong>anti-Latinx bias, anti-LGBT bias and bias against people with
                    disabilities</strong> in both departments' search practices. Moreover, when communities report
                    police discrimination or excessive force, fewer than 1% of these allegations were upheld. Our summary
                    findings and policy recommendations to reduce police violence, strengthen accountability and make
                    communities safer are presented below.

                    <strong>San Diego Police and Sheriff's Departments made 230,643 traffic and pedestrian stops from July
                    2018 - June 2019.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both agencies stopped black people and Pacific Islanders at higher rates than white people. Black people
                    were stopped by San Diego Sheriff's deputies at a rate 130% higher than white people and were stopped by
                    San Diego police at a rate 219% higher than white people. San Diego police made 35,038 stops of black
                    people during a 12-month period in a city with a total of 88,774 black residents - an extreme level of
                    policing impacting black San Diego residents. Black people were more likely than white people to be
                    stopped in 85% of San Diego Police Department beats and in every area of San Diego Sheriff's
                    Department's jurisdiction. Moreover, fewer than 15% of these stops were initiated from civilian calls
                    for service (i.e 911 calls), indicating that these racial disparities are the product of police
                    decision-making rather than officers responding to community calls for assistance.

                    <strong>1 in every 5 stops resulted in a police search. </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were substantial disparities in police treatment during these stops. <strong>Both agencies were
                    more likely to search black people, people perceived to be LGBT and people perceived to have
                    disabilities during a stop.</strong> Moreover, in situations where police had the most discretion,
                    they tended to engage in discriminatory search practices. For example, San Diego police were <strong>44%
                    more likely to search Latinx people and 133% more likely to search black people than white people
                    during a routine traffic stop</strong> - especially for equipment violations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    San Diego police were <strong>23% more likely</strong> to search a black person and <strong>60% more
                    likely</strong> to search a Latinx person based solely on the consent of the person being searched -
                    a type of search where officers have the most discretion. San Diego sheriff's deputies were also more
                    likely to conduct these types of searches, called "consent searches", on black and Latinx people during
                    a stop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among the groups in our analysis, people perceived to have mental disabilities experienced some of the
                    most extreme search disparities - this group was 81% more likely to be searched by San Diego police and
                    112% more likely to be searched by San Diego sheriff's deputies during a stop than people who were not
                    perceived to have a disability.

                    <strong>77% of all searches by these departments did not report finding contraband.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, the contraband these departments did report finding <strong>rarely posed a public safety
                    risk</strong> justifying the use of this intrusive police tactic. Drugs or drug paraphernalia
                    represented <strong>two-thirds</strong> of all contraband reportedly found while fewer than 1% of
                    searches by either department reportedly found a gun. And while San Diego police and sheriff's
                    departments were more likely to search black and Latinx people during routine traffic stops, they were
                    <strong>less likely to find contraband during these searches</strong>. This suggests both departments
                    are over-searching people in general, with little to no public safety benefit, while engaging in biased
                    policing towards communities of color in particular.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both departments also engaged in discriminatory search practices against people perceived to have
                    disabilities and people perceived to be LGBT. These groups were also searched at higher rates despite
                    being substantially less likely to be found with contraband.

                <p>
                    We obtained detailed data on 88,372 arrests made from 2016-2018 by San Diego Police Department and 28,119
                    arrests made in 2016 by San Diego Sheriff’s Department. Analyzing these data, we find that
                    <strong>misdemeanor offenses comprise the vast majority of arrests - making up 71% of all SDPD arrests
                    and 67% of all SDSD arrests.</strong> Of these low-level offenses, drug possession, status offenses
                    and quality of life offenses made up a significant proportion - accounting for 34% of SDPD arrests and
                    34% of SDSD arrests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This policing approach, which uses arrests as a response to low-level offenses, disproportionately
                    impacts black communities. For example, black people were 4.1x more likely than white people to be
                    arrested by SDPD for drug possession, despite research showing black and white people use and sell drugs
                    at similar rates. Both agencies made as many arrests for drug possession alone as they did for all Part
                    1 Violent and Property Crimes <strong>combined.</strong>

                To investigate use of force more extensively, we obtained additional individualized use of force data from
                both agencies from 2016-2018. This includes <strong>8,660 use of force cases</strong> reported by San Diego

                includes police use of batons, tasers, chemical agents, bean bag shotguns and potentially deadly tactics
                such as strangleholds against civilians. There were 1,060 cases of these types of force incidents reported
                by San Diego Police Department from 2017-2018. Comparing these incidents to those reported by 42 other large
                California city police departments where we were able to obtain such data, we find <strong>San Diego police

                    Using a methodology <a href="https://policingequity.org/images/pdfs-doc/CPE_SoJ_Race-Arrests-UoF_2016-07-08-1130.pdf" target="_blank">developed</a>
                    by the Center for Policing Equity, we assigned more severe forms of
                    force - like the use of tasers and canines - a higher score than less severe forms of force - like
                    punches and kicks. <strong>The results show both departments not only were more likely to use force
                    against black people but also used higher levels of force during these encounters compared to other
                    groups.</strong> On average, when SDPD uses force against black people they use a level of force
                    1.3x more severe than when using force against white people. For SDSD, it was a level of force 2.7x more
                    severe. Both departments used more severe levels of force against black people than white people even
                    after controlling for the level of resistance officers reported encountering.

            <p>
                <strong>Deadly Force by San Diego Police Department</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                San Diego Police Department reported 26 deadly force incidents from 2016-2018, including 19 police shootings
                and 7 other force incidents causing death or serious injury. <strong>10 people died in these encounters and
                9 were seriously injured.</strong> While San Diego police used deadly force at a lower rate than the
                state average, we identified several issues that suggest<strong> </strong>changes to department policies
                could <strong>reduce deadly force further</strong>:&nbsp;
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>In at least 8 of the 26 incidents (31%), the person was <strong>unarmed</strong>.</li>
                <li>8 of the 26 incidents (31%) involved people who had signs of <strong>mental health issues or drug/alcohol impairment</strong>.</li>
                <li>4 of the 19 police shootings (21%) involved San Diego police shooting at someone who was in a <strong>moving vehicle</strong>. </li>
                <li>In 16 of the 19 police shootings (84%), San Diego police officers shot at the person <strong>without first attempting to use non-lethal force</strong> to resolve the situation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This suggests a need for stronger deadly force policies and better enforcement of these standards to
                emphasize alternatives to deadly force whenever possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Deadly Force by San Diego Sheriff's Department</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                San Diego Sheriff's Department reported 95 deadly force incidents from 2016-2018, including 22 police
                shootings and 73 other force incidents causing death or serious injury. 12 people were killed in these
                incidents and 83 were seriously injured. This is <strong>4.6x higher deadly force rate </strong>per arrest
                than San Diego Police Department during this period and a higher rate than 26 of California's 30 largest
                policing agencies.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>SDSD used force against 96 people during these 95 incidents. 68 of these people (71%) were <strong>unarmed</strong>. Only 8 of the 96 people (8%) were allegedly armed with a gun.</li>
                <li><strong>Tasers, strangleholds and weaponless physical force made up 67% of incidents</strong> causing death or serious injury.</li>
                <li>At least 14 people SDSD used deadly force on reportedly had <strong>disabilities</strong> - 13 people had signs of mental illness and one person had physical disabilities.</li>
                <li>Of 22 people shot by SDSD from 2016-2018, 14 (64%) were Latinx. <strong>Latinx people were 5.5x more likely to be shot</strong> by SDSD than white people per arrest. </li>
                <li>4 of the 22 police shootings (18%) involved San Diego sheriff's deputies shooting at someone who was in a <strong>moving vehicle</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This suggests policy interventions should include a focus on addressing the excessive use of tasers, physical
                force and strangleholds while also addressing racial bias in decisions to use firearms, particularly against
                Latinx people.

                    In addition to use of force incidents, San Diego Sheriff's Department reported 44 in-custody deaths
                    attributed to causes other than use of force from 2016-2018. This includes at least 10 deaths reportedly
                    due to suicide, 2 death due to homicide committed by another person in custody, and 4 reportedly due to
                    "accidental" causes. Another 15 deaths are attributed to natural causes and 13 remained under
                    investigation at the time of the report. After accounting for the adult jail population in each county,
                    San Diego Sheriff's Department had a rate of 8.1 jail deaths per 1,000 jail population. As such,

                <p>
                    Our review of San Diego police arrest data identified a number of low-level offenses that could be
                    decriminalized entirely or deprioritized for enforcement. These offenses tended to involve drug
                    possession, status offenses, quality of life offenses and municipal code violations that posed no threat
                    to the public or property. Instead of a policing-based response to these activities, alternative
                    responses should be developed or expanded that send substance abuse counselors, mental health
                    professionals and other civilian responders to the scene instead of armed police officers. For example,
                    the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-mental-health-experts-not-police-are-the-first-responders-1543071600" target="_blank">CAHOOTS program</a>
                    in Eugene, OR deploys mental health providers instead of police
                    officers to calls involving a suspected mental health crisis - responding to nearly 1 in 5 calls for
                    service citywide. For example, the following low-level offenses, other than drug possession, result in
                    the largest number of arrests:

            <p class="number-list n2"><strong>Require Officers to Use De-Escalation</strong> </p>
            <p>
                Unlike <a href="http://useofforceproject.org" target="_blank">43 of the nation's 100 largest departments,</a>
                San Diego police department policies do not explicitly require officers to use de-escalation when possible
                prior to using force. Instead, the policy states that de-escalation or disengagement "may" be used in some
                circumstances and cautions officers that this tactic "may not be possible" in some situations. De-escalation
                requirements have been shown to significantly reduce the use of deadly force. San Diego police department
                should revise their use of force procedure to clarify that the use of de-escalation is a requirement for all
                officers whenever possible rather than the use of force.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n3"><strong>Ban Shooting at Moving Vehicles</strong> </p>
            <p>
                San Diego police department's use of force procedure allows officers to shoot at moving vehicles even if the
                vehicle is considered the only threat. This policy is inconsistent with the recommendations of the US
                Department of Justice and law enforcement groups such as the Police Executive Research Forum, which have
                recommended that police departments ban shooting at moving vehicles unless an occupant of the vehicle is
                using deadly force by means other than the vehicle (for example, shooting at someone from the vehicle). If
                such a policy was implemented in San Diego, it would likely have restricted officers from shooting at
                vehicles in 21% of San Diego police shootings from 2016-2018.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n4"><strong>Ban the use of Carotid Restraints / Strangleholds:</strong> </p>
            <p>
                San Diego's use of force procedure allows officers to use Carotid Restraint Holds (a form of stranglehold)
                against civilians in situations where deadly force would not be authorized. From 9/25/2016 - 12/31/2018, San
                Diego police used this dangerous tactic on 208 people. Only 6 of these cases (3%) reportedly involved a
                "life-threatening" level of resistance from the subject, while 153 cases (74%) involved someone who was
                reportedly "passively" or "actively" resisting. In departments such as San Francisco and Berkeley, the use
                of Carotid Restraints and Chokeholds are banned. By banning the use of Carotid Restraints, San Diego police
                can reduce the risk of injury or death to civilians.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n5"><strong>Address Anti-Black Bias in Policing Outcomes</strong> </p>
            <p>
                Our findings indicate that black people, in particular, had both high arrest rates and high exposure to
                police use of force as a population - experiencing 5x higher use of force rate per resident. As such,
                policymakers should consider measures designed to both reduce the overall number of black people arrested by
                San Diego police as well as measures to address anti-black bias in police use of force during the process of
                arrest. At the assignment level, the Gang Unit, Narcotics, and Task Force officers stopped black people at
                higher rates than officers working other assignments. Policymakers and police leadership should re-examine
                the utility of continuing to assign officers to these units given their racially disparate impact. Moreover,
                given the new RIPA data collection requirements, the San Diego Police Department should have the data needed
                to identify which officers, specifically, exhibit a pattern of anti-black bias in stops, searches, arrests
                and use of force. This information should be used to hold these officers accountable and protect black
                communities from discriminatory policing.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n6"><strong>Ban Consent Searches and Stops for Equipment Violations</strong> </p>
            <p>
                When San Diego police officers had more discretion - during "consensual" encounters or stops for routine
                traffic violations - they tended to use this discretion to search black and Latinx individuals at higher
                rates despite being less likely to find contraband during these searches. Racial disparities were
                particularly high for traffic stops for equipment violations, suggesting San Diego police may be conducting
                these stops as a pretext to investigate black and Latinx drivers. As a strategy to protect residents -
                especially black and brown residents - from intrusive and unnecessary police contact, SDPD officers should
                be required to have probable cause to initiate a search and stops for equipment violations should be banned.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n7"><strong>Remove Language in the San Diego Police Union Contract to Strengthen Investigations and Accountability</strong> </p>
            <p>
                A review of San Diego's police union contract identified contract language that imposes unfair and
                unnecessary limits on the department's ability to investigate and adjudicate allegations of officer
                misconduct. For example, Section 41.D.1 imposes a 3 business day delay in interrogations of officers - a
                period that can only be reduced on a case-by-case basis by the Assistant Chief. Such language should be
                removed from the contract and replaced with a practice of interrogating officers as soon as possible
                following a misconduct incident/receipt of a misconduct allegation.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n8"><strong>Strengthen Community Oversight to Ensure Accountability</strong> </p>
            <p>
                Low sustain rates for SDPD complaints, especially complaints alleging use of force violations, suggest
                changes to existing investigatory and oversight structures are warranted. For example, the current San
                Diego's Community Review Board on Police Practices has the power to review internal affairs investigations
                but cannot independently investigate complaints of misconduct or subpoena witnesses. This board should be
                replaced with an independent community structure that has the power to conduct independent investigations,
                subpoena witnesses and documents, and impose discipline as a result of their findings. For example, San
                Francisco's Department of Police Accountability has many of these powers and, in combination with the city's
                police commission, gives civilians the power to impose discipline on officers in cases where the police
                department fails to do so.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n9"><strong>Address Inconsistencies in the Use of Force Data Reported by San Diego Police Department</strong> </p>
            <p>
                There were notable inconsistencies between the use of force and arrests databases provided by San Diego
                Police Department and the data that SDPD reported to the RIPA program. During the period where these two
                databases overlap, from 7/1/18 - 12/31/18, there were 1,554 uses of force reported to the RIPA program and
                2,476 uses of force reported in San Diego Police Department's use of force database. Based on the number of
                cases in the department's use of force database, use of force involving police pointing a firearm at people,
                using batons, chemical spray, or other forms of physical or vehicle contact were under-reported to the RIPA
                program during this period. Additionally, while 13 canine incidents were reported to RIPA, they weren't
                included within the department's use of force database, indicating the department's internal databases
                should be strengthened to incorporate data that is inclusive of all use of force types.

            <p class="number-list n10"><strong>Improve Police Data Transparency in California:</strong> </p>
            <p>
                We conducted our analysis based on the data reported by California's RIPA, URSUS and CCOPA programs combined
                with data we were able to obtain from agencies via public records requests. Despite this, there remain
                aspects of policing that we could not obtain data on due to a combination of unwillingness by CA Department
                of Justice to provide data and existing limitations on police data imposed by state law. For example, we
                could not obtain detailed arrests data from the Monthly Arrests and Citation Register that was more recent
                than 2016 because the state's OpenJustice database does not provide this information at the agency-level.
                Instead, the OpenJustice database aggregates data at the county-level, making it difficult to determine how
                many arrests a single agency within a county made or how many of those arrests were felony, misdemeanor or
                status offenses. While we requested this data repeatedly from the CA Department of Justice, they did not
                provide it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the state's RIPA regulations should be revised to permit more comprehensive analyses of
                policing practices. For example, RIPA's regulations <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/ripa/stop-data-reg-final-text-110717.pdf?" target="_blank">don't require agencies to specify</a>
                whether a stop is a vehicle or pedestrian stop.
                Instead, departments indicate a "primary reason for stop" that can include either "traffic violation" or
                categories such as "reasonable suspicion." As such, both vehicle and pedestrian stops based on "reasonable
                suspicion" are grouped together, making it difficult to understand how officers may be approaching different
                types of stops. Additionally, RIPA's regulations currently prevent the public from accessing data showing
                the ID numbers of the officers making each stop. <strong>If we had such information, we could've evaluated
                which officers make the most stops - and which officers were engaging in a pattern of biased policing
                practices.</strong> Despite the passage of SB 1421, which made it possible to obtain records of police
                misconduct in limited set of cases (for example, cases involving deadly force, sustained complaints of
                sexual assault and official dishonesty), further legislation is needed to allow the public to access the
                full range of data needed to effectively track, predict and prevent police misconduct.

                We reviewed San Diego Sheriff's Department's policy manual, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Pv86g4FRLRYkk-hIFCzWLF0-4IHQroNX"><span>use of force guidelines</span></a>
                and police union contract to determine where new policies could contribute
                towards addressing the outcomes described in this report.&nbsp;

            <p class="number-list n1"><strong>Reduce SDSD Arrests by One-Third by scaling up Alternatives to Arrest for Drug Possession, Quality of Life Offenses and Other Low-Level Offenses:</strong> </p>
            <p>
                34% of all San Diego Sheriff's Department arrests were reportedly for drug possession, status offenses and
                quality of life offenses that pose no threat to public safety. As such, San Diego Sheriff's Department would
                see a substantial reduction in arrest rates by expanding the use of alternative, community-based responses
                to these activities.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n2"><strong>Ban Consent Searches and Limit Pretext Stops</strong> </p>
            <p>
                We found evidence San Diego Sheriff's Department engaged in biased police search practices - searching black
                and brown people at higher rates despite being less likely to find contraband during these searches. SDSD
                should take action to substantially reduce the number of searches conducted - especially of black and brown
                residents. Banning or strongly restricting searches originating from traffic-violation stops as well as
                consent searches would reduce the overall number of SDSD searches by as much as 31%. One way to accomplish
                this would be to require deputies to have probable cause to initiate a search.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n3"><strong>Strengthen the Department's De-Escalation Policy&nbsp;</strong> </p>
            <p>
                The San Diego Sheriff's Department Use of Force guidelines require deputies to "attempt to de-escalate
                confrontations by using verbalization techniques" prior to using force. However, while this limited
                de-escalation requirement is important, it does not contain language that is nearly as comprehensive or
                robust as the language contained within de-escalation policies adopted by police departments in cities like
                San Francisco, Seattle, New Orleans or Las Vegas. For example, Seattle Police Department's De-escalation
                policy includes <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/police-manual/title-8---use-of-force/8100---de-escalation" target="_blank">four approaches</a>
                to de-escalating situations that officers are required to consider
                when possible: using communication, slowing down or stabilizing the situation, increasing distance, and
                shielding/utilizing cover and concealment. Of these, San Diego deputies are only required to consider using
                communication (i.e. "verbalization techniques").
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n4"><strong>Restrict the Use of Tasers</strong> </p>
            <p>
                <strong>San Diego Sheriff's Department killed 3 people with tasers from 2016-2018 - representing 17% of all
                taser deaths statewide during this period.</strong> San Diego Sheriff's Department used tasers in 582
                incidents during this time, 2x more often per arrest than San Diego Police Department. As such, the
                department should impose new restrictions on the use of tasers and emphasize using de-escalation tactics and
                lesser forms of physical force in these situations instead. If these reforms fail to curb deaths and serious
                injuries from taser use, SDSD should consider banning the use of tasers entirely.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n5"><strong>Ban the use of Carotid Restraints (i.e. Strangleholds):</strong> </p>
            <p>
                San Diego Sheriff Department reported seriously injuring 28 people through the use of carotid restraints - a
                form of stranglehold - from 2016-2018. This represents 21% of all people seriously injured by this tactic
                statewide during this period - more than any other police agency. SDSD's use of force guidelines allow
                carotid restraints to be used even when no threat of imminent death or serious injury is present. Of the 205
                people SDSD used a stranglehold on from 2016-2018, only 18 (9%) displayed "aggravated active aggression"
                which is the level of resistance defined by SDSD as involving a perceived threat of death or serious injury.
            </p>
            <p>Banning the use of carotid restraints by SDSD or limiting this tactic to be authorized only as deadly force can help prevent further injuries.</p>
            <p class="number-list n6"><strong>Ban Shooting at Moving Vehicles</strong> </p>
            <p>
                4 of the 22 people shot by San Diego Sheriff's Department were in a moving vehicle when police fired at them.
                The use of force guidelines of the San Diego Sheriff's Department provide confusing and contradictory
                instructions to officers regarding shooting at moving vehicles. While their policy bans shooting at vehicles
                "for the purpose of disabling that vehicle" it includes an exception that authorizes shooting at or from
                vehicles " when immediately necessary to protect persons from death or serious bodily injury." This loophole
                authorizes deputies to use deadly force against someone in a moving vehicle under similar circumstances (an
                imminent threat of death or serious injury) as deadly force would be authorized under their policy for
                anyone, whether or not they were in a vehicle. This policy should be updated to reflect best-practices in
                the field by banning police departments from shooting at moving vehicles unless an occupant of the vehicle
                is using deadly force by means other than the vehicle. At least 3 of the 4 vehicle-related shootings from
                2016-2018 - representing 14% of all SDSD shootings during this period - would have been prohibited by this
                policy because the subjects in these cases did not use force other than a vehicle against deputies or
                members of the public.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n7"><strong>Improve Jail Conditions and Strengthen Oversight</strong> </p>
            <p>
                Our analysis found San Diego County jails have higher rates of in-custody deaths than most jails in the state
                - including a relatively large number of deaths due to suicide and at least one death due to homicide by
                another inmate. This is consistent with the <a href="https://www.disabilityrightsca.org/public-reports/san-diego-jail-suicides-report" target="_blank">analyses</a>
                from Disability Rights California as well as <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/story/2019-10-01/another-inmate-of-san-diego-county-dies-behind-bars" target="_blank">recent reporting</a>
                that finds not only does San Diego County jail have a high rate of
                in-custody deaths, especially suicides, but also that 82% of the in-custody deaths over the past decade were
                of people who were awaiting trial. This suggests the need for independent oversight and policy and practice
                interventions specifically focused on reducing jail incarceration and improving conditions for those
                incarcerated there.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n8"><strong>Empower the San Diego County Citizens' Law Enforcement Review Board to Enforce Accountability</strong> </p>
            <p>
                The San Diego County Citizens' Law Enforcement Review Board's mission is to increase public confidence in
                government and the accountability of law enforcement. However, the board does not currently have the power
                to impose discipline or determine the policies of the San Diego Sheriff's Department. Without these powers,
                the Sheriff's Department routinely fails to follow the board's recommendations. For example, <a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/clerb/docs/Annual%20Reports/CLERB-2018AnnualReport-Final.pdf" target="_blank">the majority</a>
                of the board's policy recommendations in 2018 were not implemented by
                SDSD. The board's powers should be strengthened to be able to implement policy recommendations and to hold
                deputies accountable for misconduct.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n9"><strong>Allow Residents to Submit Anonymous Complaints of Deputy Misconduct</strong></p>
            <p>People who've experienced violence or other forms of misconduct at the hands of San Diego sheriff's deputies
                have three options for filing formal misconduct complaints:</p>
            <p>1. Submit a complaint in-person at the San Diego Sheriff's Office</p>
            <p>2. File a complaint by mail to the SDSD Internal Affairs Unit or;</p>
            <p>3. Submit a complaint in-person at the San Diego Sheriff's Office</p>
            <p>
                In order for complaints to be investigated, <a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/clerb/faqs/faqs_page.html" target="_blank">they must be submitted in</a>
                writing and signed under penalty of perjury. Complainants must <a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/clerb/docs/WebComplaintForm/Web%20Complaint.pdf" target="_blank">complete a form</a>
                that requires they enter their full name and sign a sworn statement
                under penalty. The form does not allow for anonymous complaints - creating potential barriers to communities
                that are hesitant to identify themselves in the process of reporting police misconduct due to potential
                retaliation. In 2018, for example, the San Diego County Citizens Law Enforcement Review Board <a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/clerb/docs/Annual%20Reports/CLERB-2018AnnualReport-Final.pdf" target="_blank">ruled</a>
                55 complaints "procedurally closed" and dismissed them because they were not
                able to obtain a signed complaint - representing 32% of all complaints closed that year. Anonymous
                complaints should be accepted by San Diego County Citizens Law Enforcement Review Board just as they are in
                many other jurisdictions - for example, Oakland's <a href="https://apps.oaklandca.gov/CPRA/CCPComplaintDetail.aspx" target="_blank">police complaint form</a>
                allows complainants to select "decline to state" as an alternative to identifying themselves.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n10"><strong>Strengthen Enforcement of the Racial Profiling Ban and Use Data to Inform Interventions to Hold Deputies Accountable</strong> </p>
            <p>Section 2.55 of the SDSD <a href="https://www.sdsheriff.net/documents/pp/pp-20160321.pdf" target="_blank">Policy Manual</a> states that:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        "Members of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department are prohibited from inappropriately or
                        unlawfully considering race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or
                        lifestyle in deciding whether or not enforcement intervention will occur."
                    </em>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Despite this policy, we find substantial evidence of racial bias and bias against people with disabilities
                in SDSD searches and use of force. Since SDSD redacted information from the data they provided us that could
                have been used to identify individual officers, we cannot determine which officers are responsible for
                producing these inequities. However, SDSD already has the data needed to begin enforcing this policy
                effectively. SDSD or an independent oversight agency should use these data to identify, intervene and hold
                accountable those officers who's records indicate a pattern of biased policing. SDSD should also strengthen
                its use of force data collection efforts to assign unique identifiers to individuals who force was used
                against and to begin systematically tracking and publishing individualized use of force data that includes
                more expansive information - such as the weapon type (if any) subjects had when force was used against them.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n11"><strong>Address Underreporting Issues with the Arrests Data Reported by San Diego Sheriff's Department:</strong> </p>
            <p>
                We found substantial differences between the number of arrests SDSD reported to RIPA and arrests statistics
                reported in SDSD's <a href="https://www.sdsheriff.net/documents/2018%20Use%20of%20Force.pdf" target="_blank">2018 Annual Use of Force Report.</a>
                According to the annual report, deputies made
                18,613 arrests during the full year of 2018. By contrast, SDSD's RIPA database includes only 4,444 arrests
                made during the second half of 2018 (7/1/2018 - 12/31/2018) and 8,206 arrests during the full year period
                covering 7/1/2018 - 6/30/2019. This suggests SDPD failed to report to RIPA roughly half of all arrests made
                during the second half of 2018. SDSD should improve the quality of its reporting to ensure compliance with
                the Racial and Identity Profiling Act.
            </p>
            <p class="number-list n12"><strong>Repeal the One-Year Statute of Limitations on Police Misconduct Investigations</strong> </p>
            <p>Section 3304(d)(1) of the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&sectionNum=3304." target="_blank">California Peace Officer Bill of Rights</a>
                prevents investigations from resulting in
                discipline against officers if the police department or other investigating agency takes longer than one
                year to complete the investigation. According to the San Diego County Citizens Law Enforcement Review Board,
                <a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/clerb/docs/Annual%20Reports/2017%20Annual%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">15% of all cases in 2017</a>
                were dismissed because they exceeded this statute of
                limitations - including 22 cases investigating the deaths of civilians.
                California is <a href="https://www.checkthepolice.org/#review" target="_blank">one of only 4 states</a> that has a law
                establishing a statute of limitations of one-year or less on police misconduct investigations. This section
                should be repealed to enable agencies to effectively investigate and adjudicate complaints of misconduct -
                especially for cases resulting in death or serious injury.
