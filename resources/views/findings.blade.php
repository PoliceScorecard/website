                Key Findings
            </h1>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c4 subtitle">We built the first Scorecard to evaluate policing in California. Here&rsquo;s what we found.</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span>Nationwide protests demanding an end to police violence have </span><span class="c10"><a class="c12" href="https://bit.ly/2vCY7j1">shifted public opinion</a></span><span>&nbsp;over the </span><span>past five years</span><span>. An estimated </span><span class="c10"><a class="c12" href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020">45 million</a></span><span>&nbsp;Americans have adopted more progressive views on race and racism since the protests </span><span>began</span><span>&nbsp;in 2014. But while public opinion has changed, </span><span>policing</span><span> outcomes in most places have not. The police killed </span><span class="c10"><a class="c12" href="https://www.theroot.com/here-s-how-many-people-police-killed-in-2018-1831469528">more people</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>last year than the year before</span><span>, </span><span>racial disparities in outcomes such as </span><span class="c10"><a class="c12" href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-43">arrests</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c10"><a class="c12" href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/">deadly force</a></span><span>&nbsp;persist</span><span>, and the criminal justice system is not more likely to hold police accountable. In a country with 18,000 law enforcement agencies, each with different issues and outcomes, changing these outcomes on a nationwide scale requires sustained organizing and advocacy efforts in </span><span class="c15">every jurisdiction</span><span>. To do this, </span><span class="c11 c4">communities need the tools to effectively evaluate each law enforcement agency and hold them accountable to measurable results. </span></p>
            <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span>But how do you evaluate the police?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>There are substantially different perspectives about what police should or should not do - and whether the institution of policing should continue to exist at all. These differences cannot all be resolved at once, but we believe there are a set of common principles that can provide an initial framework for evaluating </span><span>any </span><span class="c1">agency responsibility for protecting people from harm:</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p>

                <p class="c3 number-list n1" style="min-height: 40px; display: flex; align-items: center;"><span>The agency should prioritize protecting people from violence, not arresting people for low level offenses</span></p>
                <p class="c3 number-list n2" style="min-height: 40px; display: flex; align-items: center;"><span>The agency should avoid the use of force, especially deadly force, to the greatest extent possible</span></p>
                <p class="c3 number-list n3" style="min-height: 40px; display: flex; align-items: center;"><span>When people come forward to report misconduct by employees of the agency, it should result in some form of accountability</p>
                <p class="c3 number-list n4" style="min-height: 40px; display: flex; align-items: center;"><span>When people call on the agency to help solve the most serious crimes - those resulting in death - they should be able to trust that agency to find the person responsible</span></p>
                <p class="c3 number-list n5" style="min-height: 40px; display: flex; align-items: center;"><span>The agency should accomplish these goals in ways that are not biased or discriminatory</span></p>

            <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span>Based on these principles, </span><span class="c10"><a class="c12" href="http://joincampaignzero.org">Campaign Zero</a></span><span>&nbsp;obtained data from state and local agencies to evaluate California&rsquo;s 100 largest municipal police departments and converted each evaluation (represented by a &ldquo;score&rdquo; from 0-100) into an easy-to-understand letter grade. Using this methodology, a police department received a higher grade if it made </span><span class="c15">fewer arrests</span><span>&nbsp;for low level offenses, </span><span class="c15">used</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c15">less force </span><span>during arrest, had </span><span class="c15">fewer homicides unsolved</span><span>, </span><span class="c15">did not have racial disparities</span><span>&nbsp;in arrests and use of force, and </span><span class="c15">upheld civilian complaints</span><span>&nbsp;of police misconduct more often than other police departments in the state. </span><span class="c4">See the grade each police department received, and the outcomes informing each grade, at </span><span class="c10 c4"><a class="c12" href="http://policescorecard.org">policescorecard.org. </a></span></p>

            <div class="number-list">

                <p class="c3"><span>We've updated the Police Scorecard to include this information, and expanded our analysis to also evaluate every Sheriff's Department in the state. Here are some of the findings from our analysis:</span></p>

                <p class="c3 number-list n1"><span class="c11 c4">California had Fewer Incidents of Police Violence in 2018:</span></p>

                <p class="c3"><span>Police departments in California reported reductions in police violence in 2018 - there were 9% fewer deadly force incidents statewide compared to 2017 and 8% fewer less lethal force incidents in 2018 among the 52 agencies that provided less lethal force data. These reductions in use of force happened despite arrest rates remaining constant at 1.1 million arrests per year.</span></p>

                <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p>

                <p class="c3 number-list n2"><span class="c11 c4">Where Did Policing Outcomes Change Most?</span></p>

                <p class="c3"><span>Changes in policing outcomes varied by jurisdiction. Stockton Police Department's overall score increased by 20% in 2018 - more than any other department in our analysis. This change was due, in part, to substantial reductions in Stockton police shootings in 2018 compared to previous years. Among departments that had 8 or more police shootings from 2016-18, Stockton Police Department had the largest reduction in police shootings in 2018.</span></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="c3"><span>Among other large California cities, San Diego, Fresno and Oakland's scores improved moderately while policing outcomes in San Jose, Los Angeles and San Francisco remained relatively constant. Outcomes worsened in Bakersfield which, along with Riverside, continued to have some of the worst policing outcomes in the state among larger cities.</span></p>

                <p class="c3 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p>

                <p class="c3 number-list n3"><span class="c11 c4">Evaluating California Sheriff's Departments</span></p>

                <p class="c3"><span>To more effectively evaluate Sheriff's Departments, we added new indicators that reflect the role of sheriffs in running county jails. In addition to the existing framework used to evaluate city police departments, we examined the sheriffs' jail incarceration rates, jail deaths per jail population, and transfers of immigrants to ICE. Based on this comprehensive evaluation, we found that Los Angeles County Sheriff and San Diego County Sheriff - the state's largest Sheriff's Departments - had among the worst scores of the 58 CA Sheriff's Departments. Between 2016-18, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department used more deadly force during arrest than 86% of departments and had the worst level of discriminatory policing of any other Sheriff's Department in the state, as determined by our racial bias scoring methodology. San Diego Sheriff used more force than 87% of Sheriff's Departments, used more deadly force than 84% of Sheriff's Departments and had more jail deaths than 81% of these departments. This indicates the need for urgent interventions to hold Los Angeles County and San Diego County Sheriff's Departments accountable for addressing these issues, which could improve policing outcomes in counties that are home to 1 in every 3 Californians.</span></p>

            <p class="c3"><span>When these outcomes are evaluated together, it reveals a disturbing picture of policing within the state. </span><span class="c4">Most departments received a score lower than 60% - the equivalent of an F grade. </span><span>In some cases, these evaluations confirmed what has previously been reported. For example, Bakersfield Police Department, which has been </span><span class="c10"><a class="c12" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/the-deadliest-county-for-police-killings-in-america/418359/">cited</a></span><span>&nbsp;as one of the deadliest departments in the nation, received the 4th lowest score among the 100 California departments. Other departments received scores that were more unexpected. For example, Carlsbad Police Department received the highest score. Further exploration of the organizational culture, leadership and practices of this department might produce valuable insights into how to improve outcomes in</span><span>&nbsp;other police departments.</span><span>&nbsp;By contrast, Beverly Hills Police Department received </span><span class="c10"><a class="c12" href="https://policescorecard.org/?city%3Dbeverly-hills">the lowest score</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of all 100 departments, due to relatively high levels of police violence, severe racial inequities in law enforcement and a system that almost never holds officers accountable for misconduct. </span></p>

            <p class="c3"><span>These findings should prompt further investigations and interventions targeting low-performing police departments within the state, not only from local policymakers but also potentially from the California Attorney General, who has the power to initiate pattern and practice investigations into local police agencies.</span></p>
