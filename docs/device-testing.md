With the website up and running on your local developer machine, you can easily preview it on any external device on
the __Same Local WiFi Network__ using __[xip.io](http://xip.io/)__.

Let's say your local IP address is __`192.168.1.123`__, you would just need to point your external device to __`http://192.168.1.123.xip.io`__

### Super Easy :)
